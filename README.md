I'm SimpleToImplement, but you can Simply call me if you want. This github account is new cause I want to be me and not associated with my past employer that is all over my history and other profile. I live in Baltics (Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia) but won't say which country.

I am quickly moving my code out of my ex-employers repositories before I lose access to them. Only issue here is that they did not let me fork anything or move as is cause some of commit history code or messages may contain reference to them. To me this feels kinda stupid but, hey, at least I get to keep my code legally and not deal with some copyright or licensing stuff to get it or use it.  

I specialize in Symfony framework, so a lot of code I have and will upload focus on that. You can obviously use my code whereever you want but you won't find any libraries here that are made for other frameworks. And please, if you do use my code, use it at least as composer package to give me some credit.  

For now, my packages will require you to have at least PHP 8.1, but if needed to be used on something older, feel free to make an issue for me to check if it is possible to be used in older verion or better yet make a pull request with version you want. Just make sure, everything (not only part you need) keeps working on that one.  

I probably won't make any repositories here on my personal account but focus on contributing to my newly made organization [SpaghettiSolutions](https://github.com/spaghettisolutions). If you contribute to any of repositories there, I will invite you to that organization. Joining is optional, but preffered to show just how many people want to help. 

If you have any suggestions, reports or, maybe, libraries you would like to contribute, make an issue at [spaghettisolutions/spaghettisolutions](https://github.com/spaghettisolutions/spaghettisolutions) repository.  

I know that my libraries do not have or lack in tests. I will add tests gradually as most of the libraries currently do not have dedicated tests or are only tested together with projects where they are used in. If you want to contribute, tests are a great first thing to do, especially for different use cases.  

I will not share any social media. If you want to contact me, make an issue at [spaghettisolutions/spaghettisolutions](https://github.com/spaghettisolutions/spaghettisolutions) repository and I will happily reply. Or ask on [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/spaghettisolutions/community](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/spaghettisolutions/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_content=badge). I prefer issue on github though
